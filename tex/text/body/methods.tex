include figure with example subsampled phylogenies

describe why we allow true polytomies to be resolved either way by reconstructions: because in treatments where there is no MRCA (two or more original lineages exist) you have a big polytomy at the root and most sampled triplets go through this big polytomy.
So when we measure triplet distance, we won't count resolving a true polytomy into two nodes as an error.
We include strict triplet distance in the supplement.

If it is critical to differentiate lineages with different founders, you can easily add a unique fixed heritable tag to each founder.
