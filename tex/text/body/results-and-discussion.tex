\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Surface vs. Column} \label{sec:surface-vs-column}
NOTE: this section might move to the wafer scale digital evolution manuscript

\begin{itemize}
    \item surf steady worse than col steady
    \item surf tilted better than col tilted
\end{itemize}

From this point onwards, only surf algorithms.

\subsection{Steady vs. Tilted} \label{sec:steady-vs-tilted}
\begin{itemize}
    \item steady worse than tilted
    \item hybrid similar to tilted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why is Steady Bad? What Type of Error is Made?} \label{sec:error-analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item inner node loss from boxplot
    \item then, it's coming from recent nodes: node density vs. time
    \item then, and that causes error: show error vs. time
\end{itemize}

sidebar: we can use differentia size to trade off between error and reconstruction accuracy

\subsection{Does it Scale?} \label{sec:scaling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item show reconstruction error and inner node count vs. pop size
    \item show reconst error/inner node count vs. time
    \item show reconst error/inner node count vs. sample size
    \item show reconst error/inner node count vs. bit size at large sample
\end{itemize}
