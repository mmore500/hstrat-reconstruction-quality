\subsection{Surface vs. Column} \label{sec:surface-vs-column}

\input{fig/col-vs-surf-summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item surf steady worse than col steady
    \item surf tilted better than col tilted
\end{itemize}

From this point onwards, only surf algorithms!!!

\subsection{Steady vs. Tilted} \label{sec:steady-vs-tilted}
\begin{itemize}
    \item steady worse than tilted
    \item hybrid similar to tilted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why is Steady Bad? What Type of Error is Made?} \label{sec:error-analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item inner node loss from boxplot
    \item then, it's coming from recent nodes: node density vs. time histogram joyplot
    \item then, and that causes error: show error category (correct/wrong/unsure) vs. time stacked bar plot
\end{itemize}

From this point onwards, only surface-tilted (maybe also tilted-hybrid?) algorithm(s)!!!!

\subsection{Why are we seeing error? What can we do about it?} \label{sec:error-uncertainty}

mechanism of error: you have a lineage that diverges three ways between checkpoints (maybe make a figure of this); the two LEAST related happen to collide at the next checkpoint --- therefore, it looks like they're most related even though they're not.

sidebar: we can use differentia size to trade off between error and reconstruction accuracy; using 1 byte differentia essentially drives error to zero (but introduces uncertainty i.e., more polytomies in reconstruction)

\subsection{Does it Scale?} \label{sec:scaling}

\input{fig/dsamp-popsize-scale-hybrid}
\input{fig/dsamp-popsize-scale-tilted}

\begin{itemize}
    \item show reconstruction error and inner node count vs. pop size (error does not increase with pop size at fixed sample size)
    \item show reconst error/inner node count vs. time (error does not increase with time at fixed sample size)
    \item show reconst error/inner node count vs. sample size (error increases with sample size)
    \item show reconst error/inner node count vs. bit size at large sample (we can reduce the error for large sample size by increasing bit size)
\end{itemize}
