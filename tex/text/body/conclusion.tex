\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

results and discussion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item surf steady worse than col steady
    \item surf tilted better than col tilted
    \item tilted better than steady, often better than hybrid
    \item it scales: generally equivalent reconstruction error as pop size and time increase
    \item greater error at larger sample size, but can increase bit count
    \item differentia size trades off between uncertainty and error, essentially drives error to zero
\end{itemize}

Future work: use strong model of tree creation to sample from among alternate trees and generate a consensus tree to express uncertainty

Our goal in building the software for hereditary stratigraphy is to provide sufficient documentation and convenient APIs to constitute a plug-and-play add-on that can be taken off the shelf with minimal effort.
Building a user base is a key priority for the project, and we would be very interested in collaborating to integrate hereditary stratigraphy instrumentation into your system or provide algorithm implementations for your particular runtime.
