   \textbf{Comparison of reconstruction quality from column- and surface-based annotations.}
    Color coding reflects non-parametric comparison between quality measure values, with red indicating superior surface performance and blue indicating superior column performance.
    Left column shows tilted retention policies, and right column shows steady retention policies.
    In cell annotations, +'s indicatve small, medium, and large effect sizes using the Cliff's delta statistic and *'s indicate statistical significance at $\alpha = 0.05$ via Mann-Whitney U test.
