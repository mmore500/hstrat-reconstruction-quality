  \textbf{Steady versus tilted retention policy.}
  Steady policy (top) retains differentia with time points spaced evenly across history.
  Tilted policy (bottom) retains differentia more densely over recent history, giving gap size proportional to time ago.
  Hybrid policy (not shown) allocates half of available space to hold tilted data and half to hold steady.
