    \textbf{Comparison of reconstruction qualities under different differentia retention strategies.}
    \footnotesize
    Steady retention experiments used column-based implementation; tilted and hybrid retention experiments used surface-based implementation.
    For heatmap charts, B's indicate significantly best and w's significantly worst.
    Heatmap coloring is nonparametric mean rank among the three algorithms, with blue best and red worst.
